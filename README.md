We have created and orchestrated multiples pipelines with azure data factory to copy, filter and transforme data from sources like flat files and htpps. 
The project is about covid-19 cases and deaths registred inn some hospitals in UK and India. 
We used azure the azure portal to create the required storage accounts (storage account and Azure Data Lake Gen2), data factory to create pipelines, azure sql to query tables, HD insights and azure databricks to mount storage and analyze data and PowerBI to report. 
This project can be used to verify my knowledges in azure data engineering or analytics tools.
